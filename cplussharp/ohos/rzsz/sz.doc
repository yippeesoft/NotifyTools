	  programs.  Unix flavors of Omen Technology's Professional-
	  YAM communications software are available for	dial-out
	  applications.	 Unix Professional-YAM supports	dial-out
	  applications with telephone directory, a powerful script
	  language with	learn function,	high quality multiple protocol
	  support, and UUCP port arbitration.

	  SSSSzzzz sends one or more files with ZMODEM protocol.

	  ZMODEM greatly simplifies file transfers compared to XMODEM.
	  In addition to a friendly user interface, ZMODEM provides
	  Personal Computer and	other users an efficient, accurate,
	  and robust file transfer method.

	  ZMODEM provides complete EEEENNNNDDDD----TTTTOOOO----EEEENNNNDDDD data integrity between
	  application programs.	 ZMODEM's 32 bit CRC catches errors
	  that sneak into even the most	advanced networks.

	  Advanced file	management features include AutoDownload
	  (Automatic file Download initiated without user
	  intervention), Display of individual and total file lengths
	  and transmission time	estimates, Crash Recovery, selective
	  file transfers, and preservation of exact file date and
	  length.

	  The ----yyyy option	instructs the receiver to open the file	for
	  writing unconditionally.  The	----aaaa option causes the receiver
	  to convert Unix newlines to PC-DOS carriage returns and
	  linefeeds.


	  SSSSbbbb sends one or more files with YMODEM or ZMODEM protocol.
	  The initial ZMODEM initialization is not sent.  When
	  requested by the receiver, ssssbbbb	supports YYYYMMMMOOOODDDDEEEEMMMM----gggg with
	  "cbreak" tty mode, XON/XOFF flow control, and	interrupt
	  character set	to CAN (^X).  YYYYMMMMOOOODDDDEEEEMMMM----gggg (Professional-YAM gggg
	  option) increases YMODEM throughput over error free channels
	  (direct connection, X.PC, etc.) by disabling error recovery.

	  On Unix systems, additional information about	the file is
	  transmitted.	If the receiving program uses this
	  information, the transmitted file length controls the	exact
	  number of bytes written to the output	dataset	and the	modify
	  time are set accordingly.


	  SSSSxxxx sends a single _f_i_l_e with XXXXMMMMOOOODDDDEEEEMMMM or	XXXXMMMMOOOODDDDEEEEMMMM----1111kkkk protocol
	  (sometimes incorrectly called	"ymodem").  The	user must
	  supply the file name to both sending and receiving programs.

	  Iff sssszzzz is invoked with $SHELL	set and	iff that variable
	  contains the string _r_s_h or _r_k_s_h (restricted shell), sssszzzz

	  operates in restricted mode.	Restricted mode	restricts
	  pathnames to the current directory and PUBDIR	(usually
	  /usr/spool/uucppublic) and/or	subdirectories thereof.


	  The fourth form sends	a single COMMAND to a ZMODEM receiver
	  for execution.  ZZZZccccoooommmmmmmmaaaannnndddd exits with the COMMAND return
	  value.  If COMMAND includes spaces or	characters special to
	  the shell, it	must be	quoted.


	  The fifth form sends a single	COMMAND	to a ZMODEM receiver
	  for execution.  ZZZZccccoooommmmmmmmaaaannnnddddiiii exits as soon as the receiver has
	  correctly received the command, before it is executed.


	  The sixth form (sz -T) outputs all 256 code combinations to
	  the terminal.	 The hex value of the character, a space, and
	  the raw character are	sent, 8	per line.  In you are having
	  difficulty sending files, this command lets you see which
	  character codes are being eaten by the operating system or
	  network.  The	terminal program must be set to	display	all
	  256 codes in a distinct form.	 Check that each code is sent,
	  and that the 8th bit on codes	0x80 to	0xFF is	set.

	  Sz -T	then allows the	caller to input	characters which are
	  echoed in hex.  You should check that	all control characters
	  can be input this way.



	  The meanings of the available	options	are:

	  ++++    Instruct	the receiver to	append transmitted data	to an
	       existing	file (ZMODEM only).
	  aaaa    Instruct	the ZMODEM receiver to convert text file
	       format as appropriate for the receiving system.	Valid
	       only for	ZMODEM.
	  bbbb    (ZMODEM)	Binary override: transfer file without any
	       translation.
	  cccc    Instruct	the receiver to	change the pathname if the
	       destination file	exists.
	  dddd    Change all instances of "." to "/" in the transmitted
	       pathname.  Thus,	C.omenB0000 (which is unacceptable to
	       MSDOS or	CP/M) is transmitted as	C/omenB0000.  If the
	       resultant filename has more than	8 characters in	the
	       stem, a "." is inserted to allow	a total	of eleven.
	  eeee    Escape all control characters and the all ones
	       character (0xFF); normally only XON, XOFF, and Ctrl-X
	       are escaped.
	  ffff    Send Full pathname.  Normally directory prefixes	are
	       stripped	from the transmitted filename.

	  LLLLNNNN   Use ZMODEM sub-packets of length	N.  A larger N (32 <=

	  llllNNNN   Wait for	the receiver to	acknowledge correct data every

	  The command "sz -T file" exercises the AAAAttttttttnnnn sequence error
	  recovery by commanding errors	with unterminated packets.
	  The receiving	program	should complain	five times about
	  binary data packets being too	long.  Each time sssszzzz is
	  interrupted, it should send a	ZDATA header followed by
	  another defective packet.  If	the receiver does not detect
	  five long data packets, the AAAAttttttttnnnn sequence is not
	  interrupting the sender, and the MMMMyyyyaaaattttttttnnnn string in sssszzzz....cccc must

	  After	5 packets, sssszzzz stops the	"transfer" and prints the

	  between Tcount and 5120 represents the number	of characters

	  Accessing a distant system using tttteeeellllnnnneeeetttt on a local Unix

	  When terminal	servers	interfere with file transfers, server
	  commands are often available to help the problem.  When
	  possible, enable the server and modems for hardware flow
	  control in and out.  Set the terminal	server to telnet
	  transparent mode.  Some typical commands are "SET TERMINAL
	  DOWNLOAD", "set session passall", and	"SET TERMINAL NO ESC",
	  but there is no standard set of commands suitable for	all
	  terminal servers.  Normally these commands are given before
	  attempting file transfers, but one user has reported that
	  the command must be given _a_f_t_e_r the file transfer is
	  started(!).  Until terminal server vendors improve the
	  quality of their product, you	may have to get	on their case

	  servers uses 0xFF (377 octal)	for special control functions.
	  The 0xFF character may cause problems	if it appears in the
	  data stream, especially uploading at high speeds.  With
	  ZCOMM	or Professional-YAM the	0xFF character can be
	  protected by giving the command:
	  set zmtxesc ?

	  Escaping control characters with ZMODEM (sz -e) may help if
	  the transfer gets stuck in the same place on every attempt.
	  Professional-YAM and ZCOMM allow selection of	which control
	  characters need to be	escaped.  In extreme cases 7-bit
	  transmission may be required (see the	Professional-YAM/ZCOMM
	  manual).  If you encounter problems with control characters
	  you should identify which control characters are causing the
	  problem.  Please refer to the	sz -T command in sz.doc	for
	  more help.

	  Flow control between the server and modem is often
	  defective.  This rarely causes a problem in interactive
	  applications whose short bursts (a screenfull	at most) fit
	  within the available memory buffers.	Streaming protocols
	  such as YMODEM-g, long packet	SuperKermit, and ZMODEM	can
	  overload the available buffering.  Some terminal servers
	  support commands to enable hardware flow control such	as
	  "TERM	FLOWCONTROL HARDWARE IN	OUT"; this assumes the modem
	  attached to the server is properly configured.

	  If the terminal server is too	brain damaged to support flow
	  control, ZMODEM lets you fake	it by setting a	window size.
	  Try
	       sz -w2048 file...
	  to enable software flow control.  Experiment with different
	  window sizes for best	results.

	  Terminal servers are designed	to accept keyboard input from
	  human	operators.  They may lose data when a program sends
	  more data to the host	faster than humans type.  Some servers
	  allow	larger input buffers to	support	file uploads.  If you
	  can upload short files (less than 100	bytes) but not longer
	  files, try
	       sz -w1024 file...
	  with your uploading program.	(Not all programs support this
	  option; use ZCOMM or Professional-YAM.)

	  When both flow control and character transparency are
	  problems, use
	       sz -ew1024 file...
	  as a starting	point.

	  Sometimes the	terminal server	software is defective and must
	  be corrected.	 Please	contact	the network's vendor for
	  corrective procedures.  An alternative is to install direct

	  We have also encountered problems when networking software
	  fails	to pass	data after a large amount of data has been
	  sent to the host.  This has happened on a PPP	internet
	  connection which prevented uploads of	large amounts of data
	  via either FTP or a ZMODEM upload (via TELNET).  The PPP
	  connection grinds to a standstill and	not even PING works.

	  Some systems enforce a timeout which disconnects a user
	  after	several	minutes	of keyboard inactivity.	 Long, error
	  free ZMODEM transfers	do not generate	keyboard activity
	  (this	is why ZMODEM is so efficient).	 Restricting the
	  window size with
	       sz -w16384 file...
	  option generates terminal input at regular intervals even
	  when no error	correction is needed.  If problems persist,

	  Particular attention must be paid to flow control.  The

	  does not set or reset	flow control modes (if any).  Most
	  Unix systems use XON/XOFF ("software") flow control.

	  Telebit modems must not be set to "spoof" UUCP, XMODEM,
	  YMODEM, or KERMIT.  Setting one of these spoofing modes
	  interferes with other	protocols.  Telebit's YMODEM spoofing
	  interferes with YMODEM transfers.

	  protocol.

	  Many programs	claiming to support YMODEM only	support	XMODEM
	  with 1k blocks, and they often don't get that	quite right.
	  XMODEM transfers add up to 127 garbage bytes per file.
	  XMODEM-1k and	YMODEM-1k transfers use	128 byte blocks	to
	  avoid	extra padding.

	  YMODEM programs use the file length transmitted at the
	  beginning of the transfer to prune the file to the correct
	  length; this may cause problems with source files that grow
	  during the course of the transfer.  This problem does	not
	  pertain to ZMODEM transfers, which preserve the exact	file
	  length unconditionally.

	  Most ZMODEM options are merely passed	to the receiving
	  program; some	programs do not	implement all of these
	  options.

	  Circular buffering and a ZMODEM sliding window should	be
	  used when input is from pipes	instead	of acknowledging
	  frames each 1024 bytes.  If no files can be opened, sssszzzz sends
	  a ZMODEM command to echo a suitable complaint; perhaps it
